1.  Go to http://netlib.org/liblist.html
2.  go to toms
3.  Download 125 (WEIGHTCOEFF) and unpack it (test it with 655 of you like!).
    and name the file. (See betlib/toms/index.)

    weightcoeff.f


4.  Go back to http://netlib.org/liblist.html
5.  Click on slatec

    (Note:1 d1mach and i1mach relate to machine precision and are therefore
    machine dependent. They have machine constants for a range of
    machines and you just uncomment the lines relating to
    the machine you intend to run the program on: naturally you must
    do the edits before running the scripts, or if you forget, do 
    the edits afterwards and re-run the scripts.)

    (Note:2 If you already have slatex installed, this won't do any harm, but what you cannot do
    is compile with -lslatec -ldors. If you want to use other slatec programs and compile
    with -ldors, don't download any of these, and strip out all the slatec routines in script1
    and script2. The same goes for any other libraries which you may have installed [including toms as above].)
