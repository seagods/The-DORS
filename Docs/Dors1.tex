\section{A First Run of {\it Dors1}}

The first thing that is required for any atmospheric radiative transfer calculation is
an atmosphere. This is the obvious place to start. The program that sets up
the atmosphere for doing radiative transfer calculations is {\it Dors1}. 

To do any radiation calculations in our ``one dimensional" atmosphere, we 
require an atmosphere consisting of discrete
layers or ``slabs". (The approximation in 1D radiative transfer is that the Earth is an infinite  flat plane,
 and that the properties of the atmosphere and ground have translational symmetry. We shall discuss the main limitations of this elsewhere.)
Each layer must have an {\it optical depth}, a {\it single scattering albedo}, 
a {\it phase function}, and a temperature profile. {\it Dors1} has the job of creating a
data file containing all this information. If the you are unfamiliar with these terms you need
to consult a standard textbook on radiative transfer such as by Chandrasekhar \cite{Chandrasekhar:Mybib},
 Goody and Yung \cite{GoodyYung:Mybib}, or Liou \cite{Liou:Mybib} before you can continue.

 {\it Dors1} can build
the atmosphere in two entirely different ways. It can build an arbitrary atmosphere
or a model of the Earth's atmosphere. The arbitrary atmosphere is determined
completely by the user, so we shall mainly consider
building up a layered Earth atmosphere from realistic data. 

The data used by {\it Dors1} are based on
the 1976 U. S. Standard Atmosphere \footnote[1]{All the references to the the U. S. Air Force
Geophsical library are available from http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/}  \cite{USStandard:Mybib} and its suplements, especially the AFGL constituent
profiles up to 120km \cite{ConstProfs:Mybib}.

The best thing to do when first using {\it Dors1}  is to just type {\it Dors1 -v [ENTER]} at a system terminal.
(If you are used to the command line, then hitting the [ENTER] key is obvious, and we omit
it in the rest of this article.)
The { \it -v} stands for ``verbose mode". In this mode you will be prompted for all the required
inputs. When {\it Dors1} has finished, it will write a record of what you entered 
 in the file named  {\it Dors1in.dat} (unless otherwise specified).  It isn't a bad idea to make a copy of this file to something 
like {\it example.Dors1in.dat}.
If, at some later stage, you wish to make a small modification, you can just edit the 
input file. Once you have had some experience of the verbose input, making edits should be
easy.
Once you have edited {\it Dors1in.dat}
 you may just type {\it Dors1}. This will read {\it Dors1in.dat} and build a modified
atmosphere. If you have a different name for the input file, say {\it Dors1inX.dat}, just type
``{\it Dors1 Dors1inX.dat}" instead. 

The following descriptions of the various options are rather dull, but will be handy to have alongside
you when you run the programme. I have posted some online videos which should be a lot easier to
follow on first using Dors1 \footnote[2]{Youtube video not yet done}.

On typing {\it Dors1 -v} the first thing you will be prompted for is whether you want to build
an Earth atmosphere or an arbitrary atmosphere. We shall look only at an Earth atmosphere
for most of this article, so for now, we always give the number 1 as a response. 

{\it Dors1} splits up the Earth's atmosphere into four distinct regions.
These four different regions are needed because of
 different  atmospheric aerosol types. In the lower
kilometer of atmosphere or so we may have different types of boundary layer
aerosols in addition to the background tropospheric aerosols. From a couple of kilometers
up to the stratosphere, we have  just the background tropospheric aerosols, and in the stratosphere we may have
volcanic aerosols. The aerosols in the atmosphere above the stratosphere are different again.
These regions follow the example of an old atmospheric radiation code called {\it LOWTRAN 7}
\cite{LOWTRAN:Mybib}, and  its successor {\it MODTRAN 5} \cite{MODTRAN:Mybib}.
If it were not for differing aerosol types, with different scattering and spectral properties,
we would not need these four distinct regions. The topic of atmospheric aerosols is not a trivial
one, so we leave a more thorough discussion of them for later, for the present we just
want to know what to input into the radiative transfer program.

Could  we treat an atmosphere as a single layer were it not for aerosols? The answer to 
this question is that we could not.
The different molecular species in the Earth's atmosphere have different absorption spectra, and these spectra
depend on the temperature and the pressure which vary with height, as does the mixing ratio
of different molecular species.
In order to capture this, we must subdivide the atmosphere into ``slabs" where the temperature and
the pressure do not vary too much. The need for the aerosol regions is less in the thermal infrared
than the other spectral regions, but in the {\it Dors}  the four aerosol
layers are used throughout the full spectral range and can be split into smaller sub-layers. 

So, let us have a ``run through" of {\it Dors1} -v. Recall that the  first question was as to
whether you want an Earth
atmosphere or some other, perhaps arbitrary, atmosphere. We have entered the number one to select
an Earth atmosphere. The next question concerns how we are to enter the amount of tropospheric
and boundary aerosol. We are asked whether we want to enter optical depths or visibilities.

If we have estimates of the optical depths of the upper
troposphere and the boundary layer then we can choose the option to enter these optical depths.
Otherwise we may enter a ``visibility" (or more accurately a {\it meteorological range}) in kilometers.
The more aerosol there is, the lower the visibility. On a very clear day we can see tens of kilometers.
 On a very hazy day, things that are only a couple of kilometers away are obscured by haze. In
this way, the we have a fairly intuitive grasp of what kind of values to enter. If visibility
is chosen, then the actual optical depth is calculated via Koschmieder's empirical formula
 as used in \cite{Longtin_etal:Mybib} for example.
In fact, this formula gives the optical depth at a wavelength of 0.55$\mu m$. The optical
depth at other wavelengths will be worked out from the combination of aerosol models used.
Again, we discuss this in detail later.

At this point we must give {\it Dors1} wavelength information. What you need to do is enter
two  wavelengths covering a range. That is, suppose we want to look at the wavelength
range 0.6 to 0.70 micrometres, we enter the smaller wavelength ($\lambda_1)$ of 0.60 and the larger
wavelength ($\lambda_2)$ of 0.70. These two wavelengths can be the same if the user chooses them to
 be so, and in this case  {\it Dors1} will output the necessary data for a single wavelength calculation.
 However for many
practical purposes some kind of wavelength range is needed. 

If, for some small range of wavelengths, there are no sharp absorption  features due
 to molecular absorption lines, we can use just a single wavelength. (I.e. set $\lambda_2=\lambda_1$.)
By small, we mean that the wavelength range is
small enough so that the aerosol phase function, single scattering albedo, and optical depth,
 and the Rayliegh scattering optical depths do
 not change in any significant way over the wavelength region. We return to this
topic later.

Unfortunately, whenever there are many sharp features over a given wavelength
range, such as molecular absorption lines, we cannot use a single wavelength approximation.
This means much heavier computation.
The {\it Dors} uses a correlated-$\kappa$ approach in this case. 
Detailed explanations of the correlated-$\kappa$ method are given in \cite{GoodyWest:Mybib}, 
\cite{LacisOinas:Mybib}, \cite{FuLiou:Mybib}, and \cite{RoseKratz:Mybib}. 
Band models are an alternative \cite{GoodyYung:Mybib} \cite{Liou:Mybib},
and when multiple scattering calculations are required, these can be converted
to correllated-$\kappa$ distribution functions \cite{Goody:Mybib}, \cite{Domoto:Mybib}, and
 \cite{GodsalveBand:Mybib}.
The {\it Dors} does not use
band models, and {\it Dors1} taylors the correlated-$\kappa$ method to an instrument response
function specified by the user. The response function data should be in a separate file.
 The the default name  for the file is {\it myresp.dat}.

If you have a different name for the response function data file, just 
type ``{\it Dors1 Dors1inX.dat Xresp.dat}" where {\it Xresp.dat} is whatever
your response function file name is. When running {\it Dors1} in verbose
mode, this file {\it must} be {\it myresp.dat}. (When calling the {\it Dors} via shell scripts it will be useful to have different input file names,
 but you would hardly write a script running verbose mode, would you?)

 The {\it myresp.dat}  file  shall
consist of one line specifying the number of points $n$,
 followed by $n$ lines consisting
of wavelength-response function pairs. The wavelengths $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ must be
the first and last wavelengths in this file, even if the
 response function is zero at these wavelengths.
Cubic splines shall be used to interpolate the response function, so make sure that the number $n$ isn't
too small for the given response function.

Note that this use of splines excludes response functions with sharp discontinuities in the first 
derivative w.r.t. wavelength.  A triangular form, for instance, should be split up into two separate 
problems for {\it Dors1}, and then combined at the end. (No real instrument has a truly triangular form, putting in
 a few extra points 
around the sharply curved peak of a response function that is almost triangular is a good idea.)

 There must be at least two wavelengths between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ (unless they are equal).
The response function should integrate to unity
between the two specified wavelengths. (It shall be normalised within {\it Dors1} if
it doesn't integrate to unity, and a warning will be output, this might indicate that the number
of points $n$ is too small for the response function for instance.) 

Now, you may not have any instrument in mind. If, for instance, you want to know the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA)
reflectance of a model atmosphere rather than model an instrument's measurement of it, what do you do?
In this case you specify just enter a constant value for the response function. It should be equal
to $1/(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)$. (It will be normalised internally anyway, just in case.) 
A valid {\it myresp.dat file} for $\lambda_1=0.6$ and $\lambda_2=0.7$ follows.
\begin{verbatim}
5
0.6   10
0.625 10
0.65  10
0.675 10
0.7   10
\end{verbatim}

After you have entered the two  wavelengths $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, you are prompted to enter how many sub-layers layers each of
the four main aerosol regions are to be split into. If you just want just one slab for
each aerosol region, enter 1 for each region. You can choose any number of slabs for
each aerosol region you like. Note that this also affects the molecular spectra used
because of temperature and pressure variations of the absorption line widths. You need to
gain experience of how this affects the radiation calculations. At this point I must mention
that the layers are not split up into slabs of equal physical thickness. They are split up
so that the pressure change across each sublayer is the same. This is because we want the molecular
absorption properties to be as even as possible in each sub-layer.

The next input you are prompted for is to choose between Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter. 
This affects what atmosphere numbers
(from 1 to 7) you are prompted to choose from next. Later, it affects which tropospheric and
upper atmospheric aerosols you are prompted for. An explanation of the which numbers you can choose
from is written to the standard output.


There are  6 pre-defined atmospheres,  and the possibility of having a ``user defined" atmosphere.
The six pre-defined atmospheres numbered 1 to 6 respectively, are tropical, mid latitude Spring/Summer and Autumnn/Winter, and 
sub-Arctic Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter, and finally
the U. S. 1976 standard atmosphere. 
Atmosphere numbers 1, 6, and 7 are tropical, standard, and user defined, and these are independent of season.

Now, if we do not use tropical, standard, or user defined, the tropospheric 
and stratospheric aerosol models are 
dependent on the season.
 If you have chosen Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter, 
1, 6, and 7 are still available. 
 If you have chosen
Spring/Summer, atmospheres 2 and 4 are available, otherwise atmospheres 3 and 5 are available.
These are the four allowed variations on mid-latitude, sub-Arctic, and Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter.

Now, some users might want to look at the interaction 
 between Rayleigh scattering and scattering from aerosols. To help with this we have the option
of switching either of these off. Normally, neither will be switched off, and you just select
zero when prompted as to  whether or not switch off Rayleigh or aerosol scattering. In the thermal
infrared you might want to switch off both.

Next, we are asked to enter numbers that tells {\it Dors1} what aerosol extinction profiles
and phase functions to use for the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere, and the boundary layer.
The upper atmosphere options 13-16 range from a normal upper atmosphere to an ``extreme volcanic"
option. For the stratosphere, the options vary from stratospheric background to extreme volcanic.
These depend on the Spring/Summer or Autumn/Winter option chosen earlier.

Now, the next section is about water vapour. This is the most variable of all the
constituents in the atmosphere.  Each of the first six atmospheres has a different number
density of water molecules as a function of height. You might, however, want to choose your
own without going to the length of defining your own atmospheres.  A common way anyone
might want to do this is by defining a humidity profile. {\it Dors1} enables you to do 
this and you are asked whether you want to use the defaults as defined in the six pre-defined
atmospheres, or override the pre-defined profile. For now, just enter one to select the
pre-defined profile.

Pressure and temperature at the ground are also highly variable. The user can ``tweak" the
pre-defined profiles to take this into account. You are prompted as to whether you have ground pressure
and/or temperature data. You will be prompted further if you say you do. If you enter
your own ground pressure that is say, 1.05 times the pressure at the ground
in the chosen profile, this will scale the entire column pressure by 1.05. If you enter a ground
temperature, this will just change the ground temperature in the temperature profile. For now, just
enter zero so that the pre-defined profiles are unchanged.

It is envisaged that you might want to use the {\it Dors} to simulate aircraft remote sensing
experiments as does 6S \cite{6S:MyBib}. The radiative transfer calculations are all done
in terms of optical depth, so {\it Dors1} will need to find where the aeroplane is
in terms of optical depth as calculated from the aeroplane height (above Sea level). If you select
aeroplane remote sensing (1) you are prompted for a height. Select zero for now.

Other things that may vary are the height of the ground, the thickness of the boundary layer,
 the height of the troposphere, and so on. You are next prompted as to whether you want to
use the default heights or enter your own. For now select the default.

The last things that we are prompted for is the orders of the two separate gauss quadrature rules.
The first is the usual Gauss-Legendre rule that calculates integrations in height in each sub-layer of each
aerosol region. The other one is for the Gauss-Hermite rule for integrations over the Voigt profiles
of the absorption lines.
 these are two other things that you need to experment with. For now, just choose 4 and 16.

We have now finished the input for {\it Dors1}, and  we have a record of the input in
 {\it Dors1in.dat}. Look at the following example.
\begin{verbatim}
1 
1 45.000000 26.000000
0.500000 0.600000 
1 2 3 4
1
0 0
13 6 3 1 0
1 0 -1000000.000000 -1.000000
0 -1000000.000000
1 0.000000 2.000000 10.000000 30.000000 120.000000
4   16 
\end{verbatim}
In the first line, we have chosen an Earth atmosphere. Then we see we have chosen
to enter visibilities,  and have chosen a tropospheric visibility of 45km and a boundary layer visibilty
of 26km. Our start wavelength is 0.5$\mu m$ and our stop wevaelength is $0.6 \mu m$. The
upper atmosphere is just 1 slab. The stratosphere is split into two slabs, the upper
troposphere is split into three slabs and the boundary layer is split into four. I remind
you that the splitting ensures that the pressure change across each sub-layer of an
aerosol layer is constant, the physical thicknesses are not constant.

The single number on the next line is 1 because a tropical atmosphere was chosen.
The first zero on the next line indicates Rayleigh scattering is not turned off, and
the second indicates that aerosol scattering is not turned off.

On the next line we see the numbers 13, 6, 3, 1, 0.
The value of 13 shows we have a normal upper atmosphere. Other values might be 14 for ``transition
from volcanic to normal", 15 for transition from volcanic to extreme volcanic", and 16 for
 extreme volcanic. Then the value of 6 means we have chosen ``Background volcanic Spring/Summer".
We could have chosen 8, 10, or 12 for ``Moderate volcanic", ``High Volcanic", or ``Extreme volcanic".
If we had chosen Autumn/Winter, the corresponding option numbers would have been 5, 7, 9, and 11.

When run in verbose mode, there is no input number for the tropospheric aerosol type. 
The troposphere type number is set
internally and will be 
be 3 for Spring/Summer and 1 for Autumn/Winter. In non verbose mode it must be set by the input file.
Make sure that it is set with to 1 or 3 according to Autumn/Winter or Spring/Summer. 
So the number 3 indictes we have chosen Spring/Summer. After this we have the boundary layer type.
The value of 1 indicates ``rural".
What is that zero at the end? If we chosen the ``Maritime/Ocean" option we would have
been prompted for which of the two this was. A number has to be there regardless of what option
we choose for the boundary layer. If we choose 3 for the boundary layer option, this last number is
either 1 for open Ocean, or 0 for Maritime.

Note that there is no mention of what choice we have made for the season. When run in non-verbose mode
 {\it Dors1} needs no such information. It is only in verbose mode that it asks for the season, and that
 information only determines later prompts.

The next line indicates that we have chosen 1 when prompted as to whether or not
the default water vapour prifiles, and so shall use the default water vapour profiles. We chose 0 
when asked if we had pressure or temperature data.
 This indicates that  we have no information  on either temperature or pressure. 
On the same line as these options (1 and 0) 
are two (silly) numbers for
temperature and pressure. These have to be there regardless, even though we have no information
on temperature and pressure. Because we have entered 0 for the option, they won't be used.  
(Make them negative to make it obvious they are not to be used.)
Similarly, the next line has a zero to indicate that we are not simulating an aeroplane.
Nevertheless, we must include an aeroplane  height on this line.  Again we have made a large negative
value to make it clear it isn't used in this case.

The next line starts with a 1, indicating that we are using the default heights for
the ground, the boundary layer, tropopause, stratopause, and Top Of Atmosphere (TOA).
This is followed by four numbers. If you have chosen the defaults, these numbers will be
the default values of 0, 2, 10, 30, and 120.

The last line is the order of the Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Hermite  quadrature rule for integrations
over height and Voigt profile.
So, we have finished our ``run through" of {\it Dors1}. Next we shall begin to see what {\it Dors1}
actually does.

\section{The Atmospheric Data}

We have seen we have six default atmospheres to choose from. The first is tropical, the next four
are mid latitude (45N) and sub-Arctic (60N)  Summer and Winter, then the last is the U. S. 1976 standard. 
We also have the possibility of a user defined atmosphere.
You will see that the {\it Dors} directory contains a sub-directory  called {\it Atmospheres}.
This contains a file called {\it Alts.dat} containing the number of altitudes defining
the atmospheric profiles and then one line for each altitude. Then we have the files
{\it Temps1.dat} to {\it Temps6.dat} which contain the temperature profiles for the six default atmospheres
and an extra file {\it TempsU.dat} for a user defined temperature profile. Similarly, for pressure,
 we have the files {\it Press1.dat} to {\it Press6.dat}, and {\it PressU.dat}. Naturally these
must correspond to the heights contained in {\it Alts.dat}.

 In these atmospheres, the only constituent profiles that depend on latitude or
whether it's Summer or Winter are water vapour,  carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, and methane. 
All the molecular species in the {\it Dors} are numbered as in the 1976 standard. These are listed
in table 1 below.

The height
 dependence of all the other atmospheric constituents are just those of the 1976 standard.
 So, to take methane as an example, we have the atmospheric concentration in $ppmv$ contained
in {\it Mols1\_CH4.dat} to {\it Mols6\_CH4.dat} and {\it MolsU\_CH4.dat} corresponding to
methane for the 6 standard atmospheres and a user defined atmosphere.
The concentrations of gases such as methane are highly variable, so the user defined option
is there mostly for CO, O3, N2O, and CH4. 

Water vapour is the most variable of all. 
If you don't want to change anything apart from water vapour in atmosphere models 1-6 or your
user defined model, 
you can copy the humidity profiles {\it Hum1\_1.dat} and {\it Hum2\_1.dat} for atmosphere 1
 to {\it Hum1\_U.dat} and {\it Hum2\_U.dat} and alter these for the user defined profile.
 Why {\it Hum1} and {\it Hum2}? If you have chosen
the option to override the data used in {\it MolsX\_H2O}, then {\it Dors1} will ``look at" the temperature
and calculate the number density of water vapour molecules using the humidity in {\it Hums1}
 if the temperature is above freezing, and {\it Hum2} if it is below freezing. (Equilibrium vapour pressures
of water vapour over liquid water and ice are different --- hence ``humidity 1" and ``humidity 2".)

So, we can select atmospheres 1-6 or a user profile which varies H2O, CO, O3, N2O, and CH4. 
Then we have the possibility of overriding the water vapour
profile using humidity data.  Two gas profiles O2 and CO2 are independent of latitude and season.
This accounts for gases 1-7. What about the rest? Are these highly variable?
 To quote \cite{ConstProfs:Mybib} ``{\it Molecules 8-28 are provided
as single representative profiles. Their natural variability can be very different from the selected 
profiles.}" If, for instance you want to experiment with the profiles, just overwrite the ones provided
with your own! The {\it Atmospheres} directory contains a subdirectory called {\it StartMols}. This contains
a copy of all the profiles that {\it Dors1} came with originally. Once you have finished, you can just reset 
 the profiles you have experimented with according to the originals.

\end{tabular}
\caption{The 28 AFGL Gaseous Constituents}
\end{center}
\end{table}

We are using the HITRAN \cite{RothmanETAL:Mybib} database to calculate molecular absorption.
This includes 14 extra gases numbered 29 to 42.
I have no idea as to what the concentations of these extra constituents should be as a function of height
, however I have
included ``dummy" profiles for the extra gases included in HITRAN. Most likely, you won't
bother with  them. In fact I have included the possibility that you have data on gases not
in the HITRAN database. these 8 extra ``dummy" gases are numbered 43-50, and you need to overwrite the
``dummy data" contained in these files with your own. Again, I should think it quite rare
that this feature would be useful, but it is included nevertheless.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Number & Molecule & Name & Number & Molecule & Name \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Extra Constituents in HITRAN}
\end{center}
\end{table}
So, gases 1-11 are the LOWTRAN gases. Gases 1-28 are the AFGL gases, and gases 
29-42 are the HITRAN gases. We have slots for extra gases numbered 43 to 50.

Many of the gases are negligible as far as the absorption of radiation is concerned.
In these cases the HITRAN data are useful for atmospheric chemistry.

 You can select which ones
to ignore altogether.
You should be able to see a small file called {\it GasMask.dat}. This consists of five pairs of
lines. The first line of the first pair consists of the numbers 1-10. These stand for gases
numbered 1-10. The next line of the first pair consists of ten numbers which must be 1 or 0.
Any of the gases 1-10 with a zero below it will be ignored altogether. Obviously, the next four pairs
are provide the mask for gases 11 to 50.
 Only those gases that
have a corresponding 1 will be used when running the {\it Dors}.
 For many purposes, only the first seven gases should have be used, depending on the wavelength.
I have included the wavelength dependence on all the gases in a separate document.

\section{Integrations}

What we need to calculate molecular absorption using the HITRAN data
is each individual absorber's mass per square cm
in each sublayer, the mean temperature, and the mean pressure. The file {\it Alts.dat}
has one number $i\_altitudes$ followed by that number of lines each containing one height.
The pressure and temperature files have the same format. The structure of an example
atmosphere is shown schematically in Fig.1 below.
\vspace*{10cm}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\special{psfile=Fig1.eps voffset=.0 hoffset=50.0 hscale=50 vscale=50}
\caption{A schematic diagram of the vertical structure of the atmosphere
as split up by {\it Dors1}. These values of {\it nsplit} are yield 11 radiative
 numbered top down.}
\end{figure}

The altitudes are stored in the array {\it altitude}, and the corresponding
pressures and temperatures are stored in the arrays $P$ and $T$.
The pressure is interpolated as a function of height to get the pressures
at the the height of the ground ($HG$), the boundary layer ($HB$), the 
tropopause $HT$, the stratopause $(HS)$ and the TOA ($HU$). Then the values
of $nsplit1$ (number of slabs in the upper atmosphere) to $nsplit4$ (number of
slabs in the boundary layer) are used to obtain the pressures at the ``floors"
of each slab (from the ground up) so that the pressure intervals across each
 slab of a particular aerosol region are equal. These pressures are stored in the
array {\it floorpress}. The height is then interpolated as a function of pressure
so that the physical heights of each slab's ``floor" can be found. These
are stored in the array {\it Heightfloors}. So if the atmosphere is split as in
Fig.1, there are eleven ``floors". The physical thickness of each of these slabs
is stored in an array called {\it SlabThick}. The distances are all now in metres
rather than kilometers, and everything is still ``ground-up".

The Gauss-Legendre quadrature weights and abscissae on the interval [0,1] are found, and using
these, {\it Heightfloors} and {\it SlabThick}, we find the height of each quadrature point 
in each sublayer. These are stored in an array called {\it heights} of dimension {\it iheight}.
The pressures and temperatures at these heights are interpolated onto the corresponding
arrays {\it Press} and {\it Temp}. These heights, pressures and temperatures are still
from the ``ground up".

Now for a bit of very  basic `A-level' physics \footnote[1]{University entry level 
in the UK}.
 The pressures in the arrays {\it P} and {\it Press}  are stored in millibars,
so to use any formula requiring Pascals, we multiply by 100. To get the number of
particles  $N$ per cubic metre, we multiply the number of moles per cubic metre by Avagadro's number $A_v$.
That is we use
\begin{equation}
N= \frac{ 100 P(mbar) A_v}{RT}.
\end{equation}
For the purposes of this article, I use the old fashioned term ``molecular weight" to mean
the same thing as the more correct {\it molar mass} in grammes per mole. I have named the
molecular weight of air as $MWA$. To get from the number density to the density $\rho$
 in $Kg \> m^{-3}$ we use just
\begin{equation}
\rho=\frac{N \times MWA}{1000 A_v}.
\end{equation}
The 1000 in the denominator is to convert from grammes to Kilogrammes. So for each height
in the array {\it heights} we have a corresponding value $N$ stored in the array $N$.

Now, recall we had a file called {\it GasMask.dat}. If $ngas$ of these 50 molecules
are not masked out, each of the corresponding molecular mixing ratio files are opened and the
data is read in. (These files are all stored in the $Atmospheres$ directory and all these
file names begin with ``Mols".  Every file (including the temperature and pressure data) has
an integer $idata$ describing the number of altitudes ({\it i\_altitudes}). If it does not match the value
for {\it i\_altitudes}, then {\it Dors1} will exit with a non zero return value. So, if {\it
Dors1} exits successfuly, then $idata$ and {\it i\_altitudes} are one and the same.
So $ngas$ of the molecular data files are opened, and the height profile in parts per
million is read in. Some of these will depend on the atmosphere number chosen in the
input. 

Now, the default way to calculate water vapour masses uses the atmosphere data
in {\it Mols1\_H2O} to {\it Mols6\_H2O} and {MolsU\_H2O.dat}. Water vapour
is an exception for yet another reason. Not only do we want to know the mass per square
cm for spectroscopic reasons, we want to know the humidity as a function of height
because some aerosol models are humidity dependent.
 So, we must calculate the humidity from the temperature and pressure
profiles at the heights in {\it altitudes}. In fact we calculate two humidity
profiles. One is the humidity for water vapour in contact with a plane parallel surface
of liquid water and the other over ice. These profiles are contained in the arrays {\it Hum1}
and {\it Hum2}. Two more arrays, {\it Humids1} and {Humids2} are found by interpolation
onto the {\it heights} grid. These are calculated using a method due to
Buck \cite{ArdenBuck:Mybib}·

Another file is opened called {\it Atmospheres/AllMolW.dat}. This consists of seven
lines of numbers followed by one last line containing just one number. The first 42
numbers are the molecular weights of all 42 HITRAN gases. The other numbers
contain dummy values which you must enter if you want some gases not in the HITRAN
database. If you have $ngas$ gases for which the mask value is one, the array
{\it MWGAS[ngas]} will contain the molecular weights of the gases not ``masked out".
Along with this array, we have the  2D array $GasPPM[idata][ngas]$. All this information
allows us to calculate the mean temperature and pressure in the each slab of atmosphere
and the mass of each molecular species per unit area with each slab.

\section{Aerosol Models}

Though users may define their own aerosol models, we have performed the Mie calculations on several standard 
aerosol models. These models have been used in LOWTRAN,  MODTRAN, 6S, and elsewhere, and may be regarded as
 the default aerosol models for the DORS also. We shall go into some detail as to the origin of the 
models and the extensive
 Mie calculations based on these models done by the author here.

First, by aerosol, we mean any particulate matter suspended in the air. As such, this particulate matter can
both scatter and absorb radiation. In general, many of these particles will not be spherical. 
However, some aerosol paricles will be close to being spherical 
under some circumstances. We  shall mainly use scattering from spheres as 
a numerical model for aerosol scattering. 

These spheres are to be 
considered as being far apart in terms of wavelength, and so the scattering is considered to be independent. By
this we mean that the local electric fields generated by the incoming radiation in one sphere do not affect
any other sphere: only the radiating far field matters.

To model scattering from a single sphere requires the complex refractive index of the material, the radius of
the sphere, and the wavelength of the light. However, there shall be a whole range of particle sizes. Therefore
we need a probability distribution function (or pdf) for the spheres that make up our model scatterers.
The problem of scattering from such a {\it spherical polydispersion} was first investigated extensively
by Deirmendjian \cite{Deirmendjian:Mybib}. If the reader comes across terms as ``haze-M'' or ``cloud-C" they are all defined by
Deirmendjian. However, in subsequent years, much investigation was done into the size distribution, composition, 
 refractive index (as a function of wavelength) of atmospheric aerosols.

Our default aerosols are due to the work of Shettle, Fenn, and many others. These may be deemed as ``out of date"
 by some users, which is why users have the option of incorporating aerosols defined
 by their own data and scattering models.

We shall begin with the {\it rural} aerosol as defined by Shettle and Fenn \cite{ShettleFenn:Mybib}. First we write down
the standard form of the {\it lognormal} distribution.
\begin{equation}
\rho(r,\mu)=\frac{ e^{-\lbrack (ln \> r-\mu)^2/2 \sigma^2 \rbrack} }{ r \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}.
\end{equation}
Here $\mu$ is the log of the mode radius $r_m$. The skewness of the distribution
 increases with the standard deviation $\sigma$.
The moments are given by
\begin{equation}
\mu_k= \int_0^\infty r^k \rho(r) dr=e^{\mu k +k^2 \sigma^2},
\end{equation}
The rural aerosol is bi-modal, and {\it both modes} consist of two types of aerosol. One is a water
soluble aerosol, and the other is ``dust like".
 Now, in \cite{ShettleFenn:Mybib} the two mode radii $r_m$ are 0.005$\mu m$
and $0.5 \mu m$ respectively. The pdf for the bimodal distribution is just
\begin{equation}
\rho(r,\mu_1, \mu_2)=\alpha \rho(r, \mu_1)+\beta \rho(r, \mu_2)
$$   $$
\alpha+\beta=1, \> \alpha >0,  \> \beta >0.
\end{equation}
In this paper, the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were $1-2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ and $2.5 \times 10^{-6}$.
The casual reader mat think these vastly different values mean that the large mode radius part
of the distribution can be ignored. However, a rough rule of thumb is that the scattering cross
section grows with the square of the particle size, so the small proportion of large particles may 
scatter as much light as the large proportion of small scatterers.

In a later paper Shettle and Fenn \cite{ShettleFenn2:Mybib} look at the effect of humidity on the rural aerosol.
The water soluble type of aerosol will grow in size as the humidity increases.
Such an aerosol is called {\it hygroscopic}.
The first difference is that the small mode radius is now much larger,  and the value
of $\beta$ has increased to $1.25 \times 10^{-4}$. The author believes these latter figures are
 nearer to an accurate description. 
 In \cite{ShettleFenn2:Mybib}. the following radii for the two modes for rural aerosols are 
tabulated.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | }
\hline
Relative Humidity&  $r_1 \mu m$ & $r_2 \mu m$ \\
\hline
 0 \% &  0.02700 & 0.4300 \\
 50\% &  0.02748 & 0.4377 \\
 70\% &  0.02846 & 0.4571 \\
 80\% &  0.03274 & 0.5477 \\
 90\% &  0.03884 & 0.6462 \\
 95\% &  0.04238 & 0.7078 \\
 98\% &  0.04751 & 0.9728 \\
 99\% &  0.05215 & 1.1755 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This rural aerosol is a mixture, which is defined to be a non
 hygroscopic aerosol (30\% dust like) and the hygroscopic water soluble aerosol
(70\%) which grows with increasing humidity.
 Suppose we  take the 99\% values, we {\it might}  take this to mean that
 $0.05215=0.7 r_h+0.3 r_{dry}$. That is to say we might take the mode 
radius of the dust (which doesn't grow with humidity) to be the same
 as the dry mode radius
of the water soluble aerosol, and then take the mode radius of the agregate
to be a weighted sum of the swollen hygroscopic aerosol and the dry dust aerosol.
 In which case, we would have $r_h=0.06293 \mu m$
for the small particle mode
 and $1.495 \mu m$
for the large particle mode. (Incidentally, hygroscopic aerosols can display
hysteresis \cite{Samparta:Mybib}, so knowledge of the humidity doesn't necessarily give
us a handle on the size parameter.)

There is further confusion here: the hygroscopic aerosol is taken to be a mixture
 of ammonium sulphate, calcium sulphate, and ``organic matter". The complex
refractive index of ammonium sulphate aerosol and ``water soluble" aerosol is tabulated.
It is clear from the data that ammonium sulphate is not in the mixture for water
soluble aerosol (or that it is a negligible proportion --- which is unlikely.)
It is unclear whether ``water soluble" {\it is} calcium sulphate or some mixture
which may or may not include calcium sulphate.

Also though ammonium sulphate is readily soluble, calcium sulphate
is only weakly soluble. So if calcium  sulphate aerosols grow with humidity, they must
act (mostly) as a solid core surrounded by a weak solution of of calcium sulphate.

So, how is one to use Mie theory with this data in order to obtain the model
optical properties of the aerosol? Ideally, we would need want the complex
refractive index as a function of wavelength and size distribution of each and every component.
Not only this, we would want to know the details of how each hygroscopic component
changes with humidity.


From HITRAN,  tables for the complex refractive index as a function of wavelength
are published for the water soluble component, dry ammonium sulphate, and a ``dust like" component
and  water contained in the file named ``shettle.dat".  The data for
the water soluble component are for low humidity. However as the
aerosols grow, they have more and water content. As we do the Mie
calculations for different humidities, we need the refractive index of a mixture
of  water and the disolved water soluble aerosol. 


We use Shettle and Fenn's parametrisation of the
{\it water activity} $a_w$ which is related to the surface tension as 
a function
of the particle radius. This radius is in itself a function of the water
 activity. We have
\begin{equation}
a_w=H \exp \left ( -\frac{0.31469}{r(a_w) T)} \right).
\end{equation}
Here $H$ is the humidity scaled to (0,1), and  $T$ the absolute temerature, and $r$ is the particle
size in micrometers.
On top of this we have
\begin{equation}
r(a_w)= r_{dry}\sqrt[3]{1+\rho \frac{ m_w(a_w)}{m_{dry}}}
\end{equation}
These equations were solved for the "wet radius" $r_w$ using data tabulated by H\"anel \cite{Hanel:Mybib}. Then Shettle and Fenn
use
\begin{equation}
n=n_w+(n_{dry}-n_w) \left ( \frac{r_{dry}}{r_h} \right )^3.
\end{equation}
This is the resulting refractive index for a completely dissolved mixture. 
(Which is hardly possible for calcium sulphate.)

So: it is not clear how Shettle and Fenn proceeded, but they say ``To reduce the
calculatutions for the current models, which now are done as a function of
humidity, the individual aerosol particles are considered to be a homogeneous
mixture of the different types of substance - as many natural aerosols are. The
resulting  refractive index for the composite rural aerosol is given
 in Table 4a and 4b. However Bergstrom has argued that using such mean 
refractive indexes  in determining the optical properties will result in errors." Shettle and 
Fenn indicate they have made calculations indicating that the errors
are acceptably small (~5\% with a maximum of 16\%). Oddly, although Shettle and Fenn tabulated
the rural aerosol refractive index as a function of humidity, they did not tabulate
the water soluble or ammonium sulfate aerosol refractive index as a function of
humidity.

We shall proceed by using the aggregate refractive index and mode radius 
provided by Shettle and Fenn, which we reproduce in the following pages. 
As a note of caution, these data were typed on a bad typwriter in the original 
data (some characters are difficult
to read) and were entered manually by the author. Errors are quite possible, however
 that may be, they should not  not lead to
large error in extinction coefficient as a function of wavelength.
