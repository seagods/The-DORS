I have been too ill to do anything much  for ages, however, I am managing
a bit for the moment and pushing ahead with Dors1, albeit painfully slowly.

There isn't enough yet to be ov interest to anyone, but the calculations
on the atmospheric data might be of some interest to someone, so use
latex on Dors1.tex and Dors.tex to get some readable idea of where I am
so far
