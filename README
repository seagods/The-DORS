I have been too ill to do anything much  for ages, however, I am managing
a bit for the moment and pushing ahead with Dors1, albeit painfully slowly.

So far, we have just basic thermodynamics splitting the atmosphere into
layers, gas concentration profiles, and reading in the HITRAN
par files. At the moment I am in the process of adding some continuum
absorption.

There isn't enough yet to be of interest to anyone, but the calculations
on the atmospheric data might be of some interest to someone, so use
latex on Dors1.tex and Dors.tex to get some readable idea of where I am
so far...
